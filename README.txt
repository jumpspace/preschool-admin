UPDATE: As of 2019, this web project is permanently 
on hold. Firebase, the noSQL database back-end I 
have been using for this project, has changed the 
structure of their Realtime Database. As such, I 
must now rewrite the entire application using the 
new structure.

PRESCHOOL ADMINISTRATION WEB PROJECT
==================================================
FOR: WITH OUR OWN TWO HANDS PRESCHOOL

This is a personal/hobby project that I started 
as a way for me to learn Javascript and HTML. I
am sure there are easier ways to learn web dev-
elopment but I also wanted to understand how 
different aspects of a web application come to-
gether. Aside from Javascript and HTML, I am 
also learning/using JQuery to enhance the code 
and Firebase (Google) to handle/manage the 
database side of the application. 

Feel free to download and enhance but please 
keep me updated on the changes made and feat-
ures added.
